## What do Web Developers do?
- In short, web developers build and maintain websites
- They often work for clients who are trying to get their product or service onto the web
- The client could be a tech company, an organization, or a government
- The work could involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development

## Types of Web Developers
- <b>Front End</b> developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience
- <b>Back End</b> developers work on the back end, or guts, of the application. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs.
- <b>Full Stack</b> developers are comfortable working with both front and back ends. During this course I will be focusing on full-stack development.
