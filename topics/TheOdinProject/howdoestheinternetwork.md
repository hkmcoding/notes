- The internet is the backbone of the web
- At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together
- The Internet originally started around the 1960s as a US-army-funded research project and then evolved into what it is today
- A <i>router</i> is used to send messages from a given computer to a destination computer
- To connect our network to other networks (such as your friends), you need a modem. The modem allows us to connect our network to the telephone infrastructure. 
- Once we want to send messages across networks, we have to connect our network to an <i>ISP</i>, or Internet Service Provider. An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers.
- The internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks
- If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one using an IP address
- It's hard to remember a bunch of IP Addresses, so we can alias an IP address with a human readable name called a <i>domain name</i>
- The <i>Internet</i> is an infrastructure, whereas the <i>Web</i> is a service built on top of the infrastructure
